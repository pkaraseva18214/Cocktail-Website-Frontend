    "description": "You don't need any special skills to create the \"sunrise\" effect because it occurs naturally. Grenadine is a nonalcoholic, pomegranate-flavored syrup that adds sweetness to balance out the tart orange juice. It's so thick that, when poured, it sinks to the bottom of the glass and slowly rises up, just like a sunrise. The key is to avoid stirring the drink after adding the grenadine so it won't mix with the juice. If you do, you'll have a blush pink drink rather than eye-catching orange and red layers.",
